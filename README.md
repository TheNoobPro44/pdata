# Protected DataStore (pdata)
This package aims at providing a simple interface to interact with DataStores without having to worry about manually handling errors or a retry logic.

- **pdata** stands for Protected DataStore, which is a reference to Luau's `pcall` method used to call a function with given arguments in a protected mode.
